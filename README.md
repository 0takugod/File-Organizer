# File Organizer

File Organizer is a Python script that automatically moves downloaded files to their appropriate folders based on their file types. This project helps you keep your download directory organized and saves you time from manually sorting files.

## Features

- Monitors a specified directory for newly downloaded files.
- Moves files to their respective folders based on their file types.
- Customizable folder categories for different file extensions.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x

### Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the `file_organizer.py` script.

2. Install the required Python packages:

### Usage

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.

2. Navigate to the directory where the `file_organizer.py` script is located.

3. Run the script:

4. The script will start monitoring the specified directory (default is the Downloads folder) for newly downloaded files. It will move the files to appropriate folders based on their file types.

5. To stop the script, press `Ctrl+C`.

### Configuration

You can customize the script by modifying the following variables in the `file_organizer.py` script:

- `DOWNLOADS_DIR`: The directory to monitor for downloaded files. Replace it with the path to your preferred downloads directory.

- `file_extensions`: A dictionary that maps file extensions to their corresponding folder names. You can add or modify file extensions and folder names as needed.

### Example

If you download a file named `example.pdf`, the script will automatically move it to the `Documents` folder (assuming `.pdf` is mapped to the `Documents` folder).
